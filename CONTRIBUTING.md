# How to contribute to VirtualHub?

First of all, thank you for showing your interest in contributing
to the VirtualHub website. If you contribute to this
project, you contribute to the large effort of conserving old
software.

VirtualHub is a continuous project. Its goal is to provide
instructions for installing old Operating Systems and other old
software on Virtual Machines and emulators.

I will probably create most of the tutorials here myself in
the order of their release, but you may want to see a tutorial
sooner or I may have forgotten some software. You may also want a
tutorial on installing the OS or other software on a specific
Hypervisor or emulator which I have not covered. In that case,
you may use
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/InstallerLegacy/virtualhub.eu.org/issues)
to ask for a specific tutorial.

You may want to report errors in the existing tutorials.
You can use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/InstallerLegacy/virtualhub.eu.org/issues)
for that also. If you know enough about Hugo and Doks to make an edit
yourself then you are welcome to fork, make the edit and open
a pull request.

If you have enough knowledge of Hugo, Doks and installing old
Operating Systems in Virtual Machines or Emulators, you can
contribute a tutorial by creating a pull request. You will be
given appropriate credits. If you have any questions, you can
contact me at
[contact@virtualhub.eu.org](mailto:contact@virtualhub.eu.org).

Thank You once again for showing interest in this project.
