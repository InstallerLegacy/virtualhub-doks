We have covered the 1960s. If I have missed any operating system which you have tested successfully on any emulator, please lest me know in the comments.

1970s were the age in which microcomputer evolved, but the majority of operating systems we are going to cover are still minicomputer ones. This decade saw the rise of many historic operating systems including UNIX, Alto OS (pictured above), Apple DOS and CP/M.

We will cover them and a lot more soon.

Stay tuned!
