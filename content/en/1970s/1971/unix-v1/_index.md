! Unix v1 was an operating system for the DEC PDP-11 computer. It was developed by Bell Labs. Sadly, we do not have a complete copy of Unix v1, but we do have a copy with v1 [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) and v2 [userland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space), which we can run on SIMH.
