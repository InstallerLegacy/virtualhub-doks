! Unix v4 was an operating system for the DEC PDP-11 computer. It was developed by Bell Labs. Sadly, we do not have a complete copy of Unix v4, but we do have a copy of a [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) that is from between v3 and v4. We can use that kernel with v5 [userland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space). It can be used on SIMH PDP-11 emulator.

## Manuals

Since the kernel is from between v3 and v4, and we use the userland of v5, here are the manuals of all of them:

- [! Unix Programmer's Manual 3rd Edition](https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v3man/v3man.pdf)
- [! Unix Programmer's Manual 4th Edition](https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v4man/v4man.pdf)
- [! Unix Programmer's Manual 5th Edition](https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v5/v5man.pdf)

You may also be interested in the PDP-11 manuals. It was the computer on which ! Unix v3, v4 as well as v5 was supposed to run. You can download them from Bitsavers:
