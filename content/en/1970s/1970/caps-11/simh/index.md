We can run [! CAPS-11](/1970s/1970/caps-11) on the SIMH PDP-11 emulator. First, we need to download the ! CAPS-11 kit.

## Downloads

You can download the kit needed to run ! CAPS-11 on the SIMH PDP-11 emulator from the [‚ÄúSIMH Legacy‚Äù website](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/):

- [! CAPS-11 kit](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/kits/caps11_system.zip)

## Using ! CAPS-11

{{< alert icon="üëâ" context="success" >}}
If you have not already installed SIMH PDP-11 emulator, see [the VirtualHub Setup tutorial on how to do so](https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org/simh-pdp11/) on Linux and Windows.
{{< /alert >}}

Extract the kit you downloaded. Inside you will find two files. Create a folder somewhere to store the files for this VM and move the file named `caps11.t60` into it.

Now we will create a config file for our VM. Create a text file called `pdp11.ini` with the following content in the VM folder:

``` config
set cpu 11/05
set throttle 5%
set cpu 32k
set ptr disabled
set ptp disabled
set lpt disabled
set dz disabled
set rk disabled
set rl disabled
set hk disabled
set rx disabled
set rp disabled
set rq disabled
set tm disabled
set tq disabled
set ta enabled
att ta0 caps11.t60
d 1000 012700
d 1002 177500
d 1004 005010
d 1006 010701
d 1010 062701
d 1012 000052
d 1014 012702
d 1016 000375
d 1020 112103
d 1022 112110
d 1024 100413
d 1026 130310
d 1030 001776

d 1036 116012

```

{{< figure src="/1970s/1970/caps-11/simh/caps-11-SIMH-1.webp" alt="pdp11.ini" >}}

Now open a terminal and move to the VM folder. Run the following command to start the emulator:

``` console
pdp11
```

{{< figure src="/1970s/1970/caps-11/simh/caps-11-SIMH-2.webp" alt="pdp11" >}}

After the emulator starts, you can typ `dir` followed by enter. It will list all the files available on the disk.

{{< figure src="/1970s/1970/caps-11/simh/caps-11-SIMH-3.webp" alt="List of files in ! CAPS-11" >}}

That's it! We used ! CAPS-11. We can create a shell script to make it easy to launch the VM. Create a file called `caps-11.sh` with the following content:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
pdp11
```

Now make the file executable:

``` console
chmod +x caps-11.sh
```

Now you can start the VM using the shell script. For example, on KDE you can right-click the file and choose `Run in Konsole` or on GNOME, where you can right-click the file and choose `Run as executable`. The VM will start.

See the [manuals section](/1970s/1970/caps-11/#manuals) on the [main ! CAPS-11 page](/1970s/1970/caps-11) to learn how to use it.

### Windows

{{< alert icon="üëâ" context="success" >}}
You should use Linux. If you don‚Äôt know how to install a Linux distro, see [our tutorials on how to install Kubuntu](https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org/tag/os/), a beginner-friendly distro.
{{< /alert >}}

On Windows, you need to place the `PDP11.exe` file you downloaded in [this tutorial](https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org/simh-pdp11#windows) in the VM folder. Then you can follow the above tutorial as usual. The shell script will not work on Windows. You need to rename it to `caps-11.bat`. Then you can double-click the file to launch the VM, no need to make it executable.
