We can run [! 4K DMS](/1960s/1965/4kdms) on the SIMH PDP-8 emulator. First, we need to download the ! 4K DMS kit.

## Downloads

You can download the kit needed to run ! 4K DMS on the SIMH PDP-8 emulator from the ["SIMH Legacy" website](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/):

- [! 4K DMS kit](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/kits/dms8.zip)

## Using ! 4K DMS

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" context="success" >}}
If you have not already installed SIMH PDP-8 emulator, see [the VirtualHub Setup tutorial on how to do so](https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org/simh-pdp8/) on Linux and Windows.
{{< /alert >}}

Extract the kit you downloaded. Inside you will find several files. Create a folder somewhere to store the files for this VM and move the file named `dms.df32` into it.

Now we will create a config file for our VM. Create a text file called `pdp8.ini` with the following content in the VM folder:

``` config
set df enabled
att df dms.df32
boot -d df
```

{{< figure src="/1960s/1965/4kdms/simh/4K-DMS-SIMH-1.webp" alt="pdp8.ini" >}}

Now open a terminal and move to the VM folder. Run the following command to start the emulator:

``` console
pdp8
```

{{< figure src="/1960s/1965/4kdms/simh/4K-DMS-SIMH-2.webp" alt="pdp8" >}}

After the emulator starts, type `PIP` and press enter. Then press `L`. You will see the following screen:

{{< figure src="/1960s/1965/4kdms/simh/4K-DMS-SIMH-3.webp" alt=".PIP -> *OPT-L" >}}

Type `S:` and press enter. It will list all the files available on the disk.

{{< figure src="/1960s/1965/4kdms/simh/4K-DMS-SIMH-4.webp" alt="List of files in ! 4K DMS" >}}

That's it! We used ! 4K DMS. We can create a shell script to make it easy to launch the VM. Create a file called `4K-DMS.sh` with the following content:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
pdp8
```

Now make the file executable:

``` console
chmod +x 4K-DMS.sh
```

Now you can start the VM using the shell script. For example, on KDE you can right-click the file and choose `Run in Konsole` or on GNOME, where you can right-click the file and choose `Run as executable`. The VM will start.

See the [manuals section](/1960s/1965/4kdms/#manuals) on the [main ! 4K DMS page](/1960s/1965/4kdms/) to learn how to use it.

### Windows

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" context="success" >}}
You should use Linux. If you donâ€™t know how to install a Linux distro, see [our tutorials on how to install Kubuntu](https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org/tag/os/), a beginner-friendly distro.
{{< /alert >}}

On Windows, you need to place the `PDP8.exe` file you downloaded in [this tutorial](https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org/simh-pdp8#windows) in the VM folder. Then you can follow the above tutorial as usual. The shell script will not work on Windows. You need to rename it to `4K-DMS.bat`. Then you can double-click the file to launch the VM, no need to make it executable.
